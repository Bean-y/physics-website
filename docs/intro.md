# Introduction

## Greetings!

**Welcome**, my name is Ben Ofsoski and this is my digital learning outcome. Completed as part of AS91903 it aims to provide an online lesson for teaching young students introductory physics concepts.

Currently this site contains two lessons,

- Understanding free body diagrams
- How to do net force calculations

I am hoping that in the future this well be able to be expanded, to provide a comprehensive online learning tool to enable students to learn physics.

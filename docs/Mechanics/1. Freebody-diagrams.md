# Free Body Diagrams


Welcome to the first lesson. This lesson will teach you how to both understand and create **free body diagrams**.


### What is a free body diagram?

A **free body diagram** is a diagram that shows the forces acting upon an object. They allow us to represent what is happening to a body at any given point by showing what **forces** are acting on it using arrows to demonstrate the direction that the forces are acting in aswell. 

This allows us to determine how the body will react to the forces, which we will take a look at in the next lesson.

Let's take a look at a free body diagram and explain how it works:


![Freebody-diagram](/img/FBD_1.png)

The square represents the object that the forces are being applied to. The arrow represents the force that is acting upon it. In this case it has been labeled, F<sub>g</sub> . This notation indicates that the force acting upon the object is **force due to gravity** (indicated by the little <sub>g</sub> ). All arrows in a free body diagram should have some notation beside them indicating what the force is e.g. gravity, thrust, drag. 

So, this diagram is showing that the only force acting upon this body is gravity. If any other forces were to be acting, they would be shown with other arrows, pointing in whatever direction they are acting in (gravity is acting downward). 

The one thing that is missing in this diagram is **magnitude**. Forces are vectors, meaning that they have both direction and magnitude. The arrows show the direction, but to show magnitude, if the information is available, we write force in **Newtons (N)**, next to the arrow aswell. 

With this we also change the size of the arrow. A force larger in magnitude should be shown with an arrow of greater length. This makes the diagram more readable and allows us to understand it better.


**Note:**
Free body diagrams do not require you to think about the actual form of the object that is being represented. By simplifying all bodies to a square or rectangle we can just think about the forces that are acting.

### Examples and Explanation

![Freebody-diagram](/img/FBD_2.png) 

This diagram represents an object at rest on a surface. The normal force is equal to the force of gravity, meaning that the force of gravity is not overcoming the strength of the surface that the body is sitting on and it remains in place. If gravity were to be greater the body would break through the surface and fall downwards.

Now someone pushes on the body. This is where we are now introduced to the concept of **unequal** forces. Because there is no force acting against (in the opposite direction of) the push force (F<sub>push</sub>), the body will move to the right. However, this diagram does not acknowledge the force of **friction**.


![Freebody-diagram](/img/FBD_4.png)

Whenever a body sits on a surface it will experience some degree of **friction**. This free body diagram now demonstrates friction. The two forces acting horizontally are both the same size though, shown by the same sized arrows. This means that like the force acting vertically, they cancel each other out resulting in no movement.

This freebody diagram looks very similar to the previous one, but we can see that the arrow showing the friction force is smaller than the arrow showing the push force. This is showing that there is an **unequal** force. What does this mean then for the body in the real life situation we have placed it in? This unequal force between the friction force and the push force would result in the body moving horizontally to the right.

The step that has been missed out in the creation of this free body diagram is a number to show the value of the force being applied. These numbers are what allow us to do **net force calculations**. We will now learn how to do these in the next lesson.

# Net Force Calculations

This lesson will teach you about how we an incorporate numbers into what we learnt about free body diagrams in the last lesson. After that we will look at what we do with these numbers to get some useful results that can help us further understand what is happening.

### What is net force?

Net force is the sum (total) of all forces acting on a body. This is why it is useful to look at them using free body diagrams. When we create a free body diagram it is generally so that we have a visual representation for the values that you may have been provided in a question.

### Lets look at an example

#### What do these numbers mean?

A common thing to note on a free body diagram is the weight of the object. It allows us to easily calculate the force due to gravity acting on the body. The normal force is equal to the gravitational force resulting in no vertical movement.

The 400 Newtons acting to the left and right show the force being enacted from someone/something pushing on the body and the force of friction keeping it stationary. 

#### How did we get some of these numbers?

Without being told it we can find the force acting downwards because we have been given the mass of the object.
Acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 metres per second. Force due to gravity can be calcuated from F = ma. 10 x 9.8 = 98N

Knowing the object is at rest we could then determine that the normal force is also 98N.

Likewise, if we were only told the push force, but we knew the object was at rest, we could determine that the friction force is 400N as it has to be equal to the push force.

Note: If we did not know that the object was at rest we could not make these assumptions about the other forces.

#### What does this mean when we put this into a real life scenario?

As we learnt last lesson, free body diagrams are an abstraction of what is happening to an object in real life.

If we were simply shown this free body diagram with these values, we can see that the resulting F<sub>net</sub> is zero.

This means that all of the forces acting on the object cancel out, making the total force in any direction zero.

From this we can deduce that the object is at rest, due to the equal forces acting upon it.

### Another example

![Freebody-diagram](/img/FBD_7.png)

This free body diagram now shows unbalanced forces horizontally. the push force is now greater than the friction force.

This means that our Fnet is now unbalanced. What is our new Fnet then? If we subtract the forces from one another we can find out. If we look the forces, taking forces acting to the right as positive, we get 600 - 400 = 200. This means that our horizontal Fnet is 200N.

Now that we are looking at unbalanced forces we know that the body will not remain at rest. Because the unbalanced force is acting to the right, the body will move to the right.


Now we have reached the end of this lesson on net force calculations.

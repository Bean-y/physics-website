# Net Force Calculations

This lesson will teach you about how we an incorporate numbers into what we learnt about free body diagrams in the last lesson. After that we will look at what we do with these numbers to get some useful results that can help us further understand what is happening.

### What is net force?

Net force is the sum of all forces acting on a body. This is why it is useful to look at them using free body diagrams. When we create a free body diagram it is generally so that we have a visual representation for the values that you may have been provided in a question.

### Lets look at an example

What do these values mean?



How did we get some of these values?



What does this mean when we put this into a real life scenario?

As we learnt last lesson, free body diagrams are an abstraction of what is happening to an object in real life.
